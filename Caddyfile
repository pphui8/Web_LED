# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

# :80 {
# 	# Set this path to your site's directory.
# 	root * /usr/share/caddy

# 	# Enable the static file server.
# 	file_server

# 	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
# 	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

# 	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
# 	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
# }

:80 {
    root * /code/webLED/frontend
    file_server

    handle_path /led* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:5000
        header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"  # Allows all origins
        header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS"  # Add any other methods you need
        header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization"  # Add any headers needed
    }
}
